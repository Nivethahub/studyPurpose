**Web development**:
Terminologies of web development.

Useful for the external third parties connectivity for the payments, authO, google etc.

*Differences between XML and HTML:*

| XML                                                         | HTML                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.                  | HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.                  |
| Used to store and transport data.                           | Used to display data in a web browser.                      |
| User-defined tags (e.g., `<book>`, `<price>`).              | Predefined tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`).             |
| Case-sensitive — `<Name>` ≠ `<name>`.                       | Not case-sensitive — `<TITLE>` = `<title>`.                 |
| Requires strict syntax — every tag must be closed properly. | Flexible syntax — missing tags are often tolerated****.**** |
| Does not display content visually.                          | Designed for visual presentation.                           |
| Tags are used to describe data.                             | Tags are used to display data.                              |
| No predefined structure — very flexible.                    | Follows a fixed structure for rendering.                    |
> Note:
> -- HTML is for browser
> -- XML and JSON is for System communication datas.
