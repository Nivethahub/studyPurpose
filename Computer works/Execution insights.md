In this topic we are going to know how the computer works and the execution stuff.

# What is a computer?

A computer is a device that takes **input**, **processes** it, and produces an **output** — this output can be a value, an action, or a task.

if there is a input, that input will be get processed and gives the output as value, or a action or a task.


### What Makes a Computer Work?

> The core components that allow a computer to operate effectively are:

#### 1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

- The brain of the computer that **processes all instructions**.
    

#### 2. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

- A **temporary memory** used to store data that the CPU needs immediately.
    

#### 3. **Storage (SSD/HDD)**

- A **long-term memory** where data and programs are stored persistently.

Storage ,CPU and RAM.

### How the CPU, RAM, and Storage Work Together

1. **CPU and RAM are tightly connected** — CPU always works with data in RAM.
    
2. When the CPU **needs data**, it first checks RAM.
    
3. If the data is not in RAM, the CPU **instructs Storage** to send it to RAM.
    
4. After RAM receives the data, it is **fed to the CPU** for processing.
    
5. Once processed, **output is sent to the display** or an output device.
    
6. RAM holds data **temporarily**, while Storage retains it **permanently**.
